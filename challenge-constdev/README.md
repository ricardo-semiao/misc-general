# Constellation Dev Challenge 2022 - Team GVCode

Welcome! This is the repository for the [GVCode](https://www.linkedin.com/company/fgvcode/)'s team entry to the Constellation Dev Challenge 2022. The team was comprised of me (Ricardo Semi√£o), [Victor Dutra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victorlaubedutra/), and [Bruno Erlong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruno-ting-erlong-a12479224/).

Constellation Asset Management is known by their valuation challenge, and the Dev Challenge was their first on the data science field. The goal was to predict the Brazilian stock market flow, and was made in three parts: (i) initial model submission on Kaggle, (ii) report explaining the model and the process of creating it, and (iii) in person presentation with the three best groups, at the firm's HQ.

The team got the best prediction error, and the second place overall.

Repository organization:

- The final model is [final_model](final_model.ipynb), the report from phase 2 is [report.pdf](report.pdf), and the presentation from phase 3 is [presentation.pdf](presentation.pdf).
- The .docx and .pptx files that created them are in [texts/](texts/)
- The files. The data given by the organization, and some extra created datasets, live in [data/](data/).
- The [scripts/](scripts) folder has some extra scripts with exploratory analysis of the data, some initial models, and visualizations for the final results.
